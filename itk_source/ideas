Check `8.5.3 Plotting Joint Histograms' in ITK Software Guide.
Is the centre of rotation set in the middle of the two images for the 2D and the 3D registration? or at the origin?
3D registration behaves differently with a moving image mask as without.

I could either subclass the initialiser and override the method for calculating moments, or play with rotation matrices until the hearts are well aligned.

Extract all parameters from MultiResRegistrationCommand into config.

Use transform3D.GetRotationMatrix() and transform3D.GetOffset() instead of using scipy to calculate them from versors.

If need to see the full set of transform params, or to read a transform file without knowing the type of transform in the file, check out TransformReadWrite.cxx in the examples.
