Metric uses grayscale intensity of image automatically, so no need to remove colour from downsampled images (see ITK Software Guide, p415)

Investigate region-based metric evaluation with SetFixedImageMask() and SetMovingImageMask() (also see p415)

In the writeup, plot various metric's/interpolator's cost functions in parameter space (p417)
