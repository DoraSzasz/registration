Check `8.5.3 Plotting Joint Histograms' in ITK Software Guide.
Is the centre of rotation set in the middle of the two images for the 2D and the 3D registration? or at the origin?
3D registration behaves differently with a moving image mask as without.


TODO:
Set up MRI to construct transformed volume and mask volume, then build vectors of slices in 'slices' and 'maskSlices' for external use.

I could either subclass the initialiser and override the method for calculating moments, or play with rotation matrices until the hearts are well aligned.

See void itkImage::FillBuffer() in itkImage.h

Extract all parameters from MultiResRegistrationCommand into config.
